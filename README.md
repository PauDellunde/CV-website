# Hypermedia Project — Part 1: CV Website

## 1) Project analysis

1.1 Profile
**Name:** Pau Dellundé
**Role:** Computer Science Student from the UdG
**Goals:** The main goal is to have a professional online CV, showing technical skills and personality in a clean and accessible way. The website will be used as a kind of digital business card, to be shared with companies. It should make a strong first impression and allow visitors to understand his background, main projects, and contact details in less than two minutes.
**Motivations:** Wanting to become a software developer, I would like to prove that I am capable of designing and implementing modern and user-friendly interfaces, but also to point out my academic path and personal projects. My purpose is to make my CV stand out from the crowd when applying for internships or junior positions in tech companies, proving that I can combine creativity and technical precision.
**Frustrations:** Trying to make the best Cv without having to make complex layouts, heavy animations, and confusing structures that eventually will make the recruiter lose focus and may cost me my opportunity. Also trying to reduce and summarize every aspect so it's not too long.
**Context of use:** The website is meant to be mainly accessed from desktop and any device, having as a final goal that it would be easy for any recruiter who's interested in me to be able to read it easily.
Success criteria: At a glance, this page should answer, "Who is Pau Dellundé?", "What can he do?" and "How can I contact him?". A clear hierarchy, coherence in style and smooth navigation will provide a professional and credible impression.

1.2 Information architecture:
This project is a **single-page personal website**, organized in a logical flow from top to bottom, reflecting how usually recruiters and professors go through digital CVs. The first block introduces the author: name, academic background, and a short personal statement summarizing goals and interests. It also includes two main calls to action: view personal projects and download a PDF version of the CV. Put this at the very top to make sure the most relevant information is available immediately.

The next section, **Skills**, shows several important technical abilities and tools, listed in categories like Programming, Web Development, Databases, and Other Tools. Using compact chips allows visitors to easily get an overview of the technologies mastered. Further on, the **Experience** section, in reverse chronological order, mentions internships, collaborations, or academic/personal projects that proved practical knowledge and growth. Each experience entry includes position, period, and a brief list with achievements or responsibilities.

The **Projects** section includes tangible proof of work. Each project card includes a title, short description, technology stack, and links to live demos or GitHub repositories. Next, **Education & Certificates** summarizes university studies and relevant online courses with a focus on continuous learning. Finally, **Contact** compiles the most direct ways of communication: email, LinkedIn, and GitHub.

A sticky header with anchor links for navigation across sections makes it easy to jump between them. Alternating background tones provide nuanced visual separation while maintaining flow. Overall, the information architecture is simple, clear, and efficient, guiding visitors organically through Pau Dellundé's academic and professional profile.

1.3 Visual design
Visual design is intended to be simple, readable, and coherent with my personal brand as a computer science student and aspiring developer. The color palette takes inspiration from the dark interfaces common in all types of programming environments. For backgrounds, dark blue shades (`#0b132b`, `#1c2541`) are meant to reduce glare and give a modern professional look. Such an accent color (`#00d1b2`) can add some personality and highlight interactive parts like buttons, section titles, and hover effects. This limited palette allows for a clean and consistent look throughout. Typography relies on **Inter**, a sans-serif font that ensures high legibility on both large and small screens. Different font weights create a clear hierarchy: bold for titles, medium for subtitles, and regular for body text. The layout follows a grid structure to maintain balanced white space and easy scanning. Each block of content is crafted with rounded corners, subtle shadows, and smooth spacing to enhance the readability. Other design considerations included accessibility and responsiveness. The contrast ratio is per WCAG-AA standards, all links have a distinct difference in appearance, and semantic HTML elements are used to ensure screen-reader compatibility. The design adjusts well for mobile screens by rearranging the elements in a single column and ensuring a comfortable browsing experience on any device. The overall goal of the visual design is to combine a professional appearance with simplicity. With this, we are trying to achieve making the website feel credible, lightweight, and easy to use.
